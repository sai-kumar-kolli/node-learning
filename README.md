## Node.js Backend Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Fundamentals & Core Concepts

- Node.js runtime: event loop, asynchronous programming
- Core modules: `http`, `fs`, `path`, `events`
- Building simple servers and RESTful APIs
- Express.js basics and routing
- CRUD operations (file system, JSON, SQLite)
- npm: package management and scripts
- Error handling, debugging, and logging
- Callbacks, promises, async/await

### Phase 2: Intermediate Development

- Databases: MongoDB (Mongoose), SQL (Sequelize/Knex)
- Authentication & authorization: JWT, OAuth
- Request validation and input sanitization
- Project structure: MVC, services, routers
- Environment variables and configuration
- Middleware patterns and error handling
- Unit testing: Jest, Mocha
- API documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI

### Phase 3: Advanced Engineering

- Scalability: clustering, load balancing
- Caching: Redis, in-memory strategies
- Message queues: RabbitMQ, Kafka
- Security: OWASP, rate limiting, CORS, helmet
- Advanced testing: integration, mocks, coverage
- Performance profiling and optimization
- API versioning and backward compatibility
- CI/CD pipelines: GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- Containerization: Docker

### Phase 4: Infrastructure & Cloud

- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP overview
- Serverless: AWS Lambda, alternatives
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, CloudFormation
- Monitoring & alerting: Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic
- Logging aggregation: ELK stack, Fluentd
- High availability, fault tolerance, disaster recovery
- Security compliance: encryption, secrets management
- Autoscaling, load balancing
- Networking: DNS, HTTP/2, WebSockets

### Phase 5: System Design & Architecture

- System design principles and patterns
- Monoliths vs microservices: tradeoffs
- API Gateway, service discovery, service mesh
- Database scaling: sharding, replication, CAP theorem
- Event sourcing, CQRS, eventual consistency
- Scalability, maintainability, observability
- Cloud cost optimization
- Multi-region/global architecture
- Documenting and communicating architecture decisions
