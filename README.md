### Node.js Event Loop Phases (Visual Guide)

Below is a simplified diagram of the Node.js event loop execution order:

```
Synchronous Code
    ↓
process.nextTick (Microtask)
    ↓
Promise (Microtask)
    ↓
Timers Phase (setTimeout, setInterval)
    ↓
Pending Callback Phase
    ↓
Idle Phase
    ↓
Poll Phase (I/O callbacks)
    ↓
Check Phase (setImmediate)
    ↓
Close Phase
```

**Node.js Event Loop Execution Order:**

- **Synchronous code runs first:** All top-level code executes before any asynchronous callbacks.
- **process.nextTick has highest priority:** Runs immediately after the current operation, before other microtasks and event loop phases.
- **Promise microtasks:** Executed after `process.nextTick`, before timers and I/O.
- **Timers execute when their delay is reached:** `setTimeout` and `setInterval` callbacks run in the timers phase.
- **setImmediate executes after timers:** Runs in the check phase, after I/O events and timers.
- **Event loop phases:** Node.js processes callbacks in a specific order—timers, pending callbacks, idle, poll (I/O), check (`setImmediate`), and close.

> Understanding these phases helps you predict callback execution order and avoid common pitfalls in asynchronous Node.js code.

### Node.js Event Loop & Pitfalls

- **JavaScript is single-threaded:** JS executes code on a single thread, but handles asynchronous operations via the event loop.
- **Node.js runtime:** Combines the V8 engine (for JS execution) and libuv (for async I/O via event loop).
- **Execution order:** Synchronous code runs first, followed by microtasks (`process.nextTick`, Promises), then event loop phases: timers → pending callbacks → idle → poll → check → close.
- **Timer phase:** Executes expired timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`). Timers are not precise—heavy synchronous or blocking code can delay their execution.
- **Pending callback phase:** Handles callbacks deferred from the poll phase, such as certain TCP errors.
- **Idle phase:** Reserved for internal system operations.
- **Poll phase:** Where most I/O (file, network, OS) is processed. Determines when timers are eligible to run. If the poll phase is busy (e.g., with blocking operations), timers and callbacks may be delayed.
- **Check phase:** Executes `setImmediate` callbacks. These run after poll phase, ensuring output processing doesn't block new I/O.
- **Close phase:** Handles cleanup (e.g., closing sockets, releasing resources).
- **Common pitfalls:**
    - **Blocking the event loop:** Synchronous or CPU-intensive code (e.g., loops, crypto) can block all requests—use worker threads or offload heavy tasks.
    - **Uncaught exceptions:** Can crash the process—always handle errors and use domains or error boundaries.
    - **Callback hell:** Deeply nested callbacks are hard to maintain—prefer promises or async/await.
    - **Memory leaks:** Unmanaged resources or listeners can exhaust memory—monitor usage and clean up properly.
    - **Inaccurate timers:** Don't rely on timer precision for critical tasks; use proper scheduling or external tools if needed.
    - **Improper async handling:** Forgetting to await promises or handle errors can cause unpredictable behavior.

#### Examples Explanation – `Basics.js`

- **Synchronous execution:**  
    The synchronous code runs first, so the output sequence begins with `start` and ends with `end`.

- **Timers and asynchronous execution:**  
    In the second example, the synchronous code (`start` and `end`) executes immediately. The message `Executed after 2 seconds` appears later, during the timers phase of the event loop, after the specified delay.

- **Timers and asynchronous execution with `setImmediate`:**  
    In the third example, two timers are registered—one with `setTimeout` and one with `setImmediate`. The event loop initializes, and synchronous code executes first, so the output begins with `start` and ends with `end`.  
    The key detail is how `setImmediate` behaves:  
    - If `setImmediate` is called during the poll phase (typically after I/O operations), its callback is executed before any timers scheduled with `setTimeout`.  
    - If `setImmediate` is used outside the poll phase (e.g., at the top level of a script), the execution order between `setImmediate` and `setTimeout` is not guaranteed and may vary depending on the environment.  
    This demonstrates the nuanced scheduling of asynchronous callbacks in Node.js and highlights why understanding event loop phases is important for predictable timing.

- **High-priority callbacks: `process.nextTick` and Promises**
  
    In Example 4, synchronous code executes first. Next, callbacks scheduled with `process.nextTick` run, followed by Promise callbacks (microtasks), and then the event loop phases (timers, I/O, etc.) as discussed earlier.

    `process.nextTick` is a Node.js-specific API that schedules a callback to run immediately after the current operation completes, but before the event loop continues to the next phase. This makes it higher priority than timers and I/O callbacks. It's useful for deferring execution without waiting for the event loop, but overusing it can starve the event loop and delay other asynchronous operations.

    Note: `process.nextTick` and Promise microtasks are not part of the standard event loop phases—they run in a special microtask queue that is processed after each phase of the event loop, ensuring their callbacks execute before other asynchronous tasks.

> These examples illustrate how Node.js prioritizes synchronous code before handling asynchronous callbacks, such as those scheduled with `setTimeout`.

#### Examples Explanation – **lesson_two.js**

### Node.js Event Loop – Poll Phase Deep Dive

The **poll phase** of the Node.js event loop is crucial for handling asynchronous I/O operations. This includes tasks such as network requests, file system reads/writes, database queries, and process management. During this phase, Node.js listens for completed I/O events and executes their associated callbacks.

- **I/O Handling:**  
    - Network requests rely on the operating system's notification system (not threads).
    - File operations (e.g., `fs.readFile`) use libuv's worker threads for non-blocking execution.
- **Callback Scheduling:**  
    When an I/O callback schedules additional asynchronous work (like another I/O operation or a timer), those tasks are queued for the next event loop iteration. This design prevents blocking and enables efficient chaining of asynchronous operations.
- If the Poll queue has no ready I/O yet, libuv doesn’t sit around waiting; it can jump straight to Check and run setImmediate.

This mechanism allows Node.js to manage many concurrent operations without blocking the main thread, ensuring predictable and scalable performance.

#### Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

**Good: Immediate Follow-up Processing**

```javascript
fs.readFile('config.json', (err, data) => {
    // I/O notification complete
    setImmediate(() => {
        // Heavy processing in Check phase
        processConfiguration(data);
    });
});
```
*Use `setImmediate` to defer heavy work to the check phase, keeping I/O callbacks fast.*

---

**Bad: Heavy Work in I/O Callbacks**

```javascript
fs.readFile('data.txt', (err, data) => {
    // This blocks other I/O operations!
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
        processItem(data);
    }
});
```
*Avoid CPU-intensive work directly in I/O callbacks, as it blocks the event loop and delays other operations.*

---

**Good: Chunked Processing**

```javascript
fs.readFile('data.txt', (err, data) => {
    const items = parseData(data);

    function processChunk(startIndex) {
        // Process 100 items at a time
        for (let i = 0; i < 100 && startIndex + i < items.length; i++) {
            processItem(items[startIndex + i]);
        }

        if (startIndex + 100 < items.length) {
            setImmediate(() => processChunk(startIndex + 100));
        }
    }

    processChunk(0);
});
```
*Break up heavy processing into smaller chunks using `setImmediate` to keep the event loop responsive.*

---

#### Why This Design Works

- **Efficiency:** A single thread can handle thousands of I/O operations concurrently.
- **Responsiveness:** I/O callbacks remain fast, preventing delays for other operations.
- **Scalability:** Memory usage stays low, even with many connections.
- **Predictability:** Clear separation of phases ensures reliable scheduling and execution.

> In summary, the poll phase is where most external operations are processed, and any new asynchronous tasks scheduled by I/O callbacks are deferred to subsequent event loop cycles.
